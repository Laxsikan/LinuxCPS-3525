CGI-Mini-Projects
-----------------
Made for the course Programming in the Unix Environment, I dedicated these projects to teach me about how to develop in a Unix Environment without an IDE, all through a terminal. They helped me not only understand how to program in a terminal, but how to make some of my first web pages, and I also learned that through CGI and HTML forms you can proccess user requests with more advanced langauges like Java and Python by using the CGI process.

Projects
--------
Student Grades Program - A program that accepts a user file and operates on it, creating a clean html result

Local Weather Program - A program that automatically takes a user's ip and serves them their local weather

Zipcode File Analyzer Program - A program that accepts two files, and with Java, emulates SQL commands such as Group By in order to create a clean HTML table result

Notes
-----
Since the project uses CGI, it comprises three sets of folders. The Project 1, 2, and 3 folders contain all the websites that users connect to, as well as all the frontend information. These folders also act as the brains of most of the projects, processing requests sent by the CGI Projects. The only exception is the Local Weather Program, which is entirely handled by PHP and combined with the front end.
