CGI-Mini-Projects
-----------------
Made for the course Programming in the Unix Environment, I dedicated these projects to teach me about how to develop in a Unix Environment without an IDE, all through a terminal. They helped me not only understand how to program in a terminal, but how to make some of my first web pages, and I also learned that through CGI and HTML forms you can proccess user requests with more advanced langauges like Java and Python by using the CGI process.

Projects
--------
Student Grades Program - A program that accepts a user file and operates on it, creating a clean html result
Local Weather Program - A program that automatically takes a user's ip and serves them their local weather
Zipcode File Analyzer Program - A program that accepts two files, and with Java, emulates SQL commands such as Group By in order to create a clean HTML table result

Notes
-----
Since the project uses CGI, the project is made up of two folders. The CGI Mini Projects folder, which hold all the websites that users connect to, as well as hold all the front end information, and the CGI folder, which acts as the brain of the majority of the projects, which processes requests sent by the CGI Mini Projects. The only exception is the Local Weather Program, which is all handled by PHP, and is combined with the frontend in the file "temperature.php."
